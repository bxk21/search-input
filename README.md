# Search Input

This project is made to fulfill the AAALife Frontend Interview assignment 1.1

## Tech Stack

This project is built with NextJS. It uses the `next`, `react`, and `axios` libraries.

## Implementation Notes

The supplied X-Rapidapi-Key is invalid. Perhaps it's old, or perhaps someone else leaked it.

Instead, I spoofed example data to display.

I would normally put the key into an `.env` file, but I'm afraid it'd be too much hassle to test.

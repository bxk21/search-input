# Search Input

This project is made to fulfill the AAALife Frontend Interview assignment 1.1

## Tech Stack

This project is built with NextJS. It uses the `next`, `react`, and `axios` libraries.

## Implementation Notes

* I would normally put the key into an `.env` file, but I'm afraid it'd be too much hassle for the end user to test.

* My RocketAPI account is the basic free one, so only 100 API calls are allowed. If so, please use the exampleResponse data in the searchAPI.ts file.

* Check out my `rtkq` project for extremely in-depth API calls and implementations.
